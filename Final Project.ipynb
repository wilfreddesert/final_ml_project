    "The dataset used in this project contains 14 variables. The independent variable that needs to be predicted, 'diagnosis', determines whether a person is healthy or suffer from heart disease. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on endeavours to distinguish disease presence (values 1, 2, 3, 4) from absence (value 0). There are several missing attribute values, distinguished with symbol '?'. The header row is missing in this dataset, so the column names have to be inserted manually.\n",
